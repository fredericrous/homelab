# FluxCD Migration Log

## Phase 0: Preparation - COMPLETED

### 2024-12-21 - Initial Setup
- ✅ Created flux-migration branch
- ✅ Set up directory structure:
  - clusters/homelab/flux-system/
  - clusters/homelab/infrastructure/{sources,configs,controllers}/
  - clusters/homelab/apps/{base,overlays}/
- ✅ Created cluster-config.yaml ConfigMap with all environment values from .env
- ✅ Ran AVP placeholder scan - found 14 placeholders (13 secrets, 1 config)
